Example app using the Google Cloud Machine Learning functionality.
This app utilizes:
the Blobstore API to upload, manage, serve and delete blobs.
the Task Queue API for tasks on blobs.
the Channel API for messaging about blobs.
the Datastore API for notes about blobs.

The app uses a wrapper around the standard blob to be able to associate a user and upload date with each blob. More fields could easily be added.
